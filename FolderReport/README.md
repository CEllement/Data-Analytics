<h3>Folder Analysis Report</h3>

This report will provide some analysis on a folder of your choosing. You will need to run the PowerShell Script (FolderReport.ps1) and provide a folder path for it to run on. Example if the PowerShell script is in c:\Temp\Scripts\ and you want to perform a folder analysis against all sub-folders and files in c:\Temp:

<code>c:\Temp\Scripts\FolderReport.ps1 -FolderPath "c:\Temp"</code>
